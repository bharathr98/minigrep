# minigrep

This is a short project to re-implement `grep` to understand how string search using Boyer-Moore algorithm works. This will probably go through two write cycles - first in C and then in Rust. Why? For the plot man, for the plot.

This is a part of a bunch of miniX projects I have done where I re-implement a simple version of something to understand how it works. A full list of all these projects can be found here -
